This is my personal project

It is based on the well known Internet legend "The Backrooms". Depicting 1000+ Levels of limnal Horror.

This will not cover 1000+ Levels of Liminal Horror but I aim to make a cohesive game that has branching paths. Working Combat and most importanly the Backrooms themselves.

To read more details on the Backrooms search for the Backrooms Wikidot. A colloabritve writing effort where works are written, reviewed and posted to the internet. Most lore on the backrooms is derived from there.

This is not a 1-1 Recreation of the backrooms. I will take my own path with the story but the oringal source can be found there.
